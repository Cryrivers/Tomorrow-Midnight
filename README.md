# Tomorrow Midnight Color Scheme

> Enhanced Tomorrow Night color scheme optimized for [babel-sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) (also known as **6to5-sublime**) JavaScript syntax highlighter.

This color scheme is not yet finished. I'll constantly improve it and submit it to Package Control when it is ready.
